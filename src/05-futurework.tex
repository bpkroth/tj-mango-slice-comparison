\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

Due to lack of time, our current study only incorporates a few brief sample tests.
For better results, a longitudinal study incorporating additional aspects such as blood sugar measurements, time of day, auxiliary diet, environmental conditions including temperature and humidity, and phase of the moon are suggested.
We postpone such efforts until further funding and motivation can be obtained.
