Snacks are critical components to any creative process.
They provide necessary nutrients to power brain processes, as well as enjoyment for the individual.
Yet, many snack consumers lack the time for careful consideration of this important aspect to their activities.
In this study, we compare two types of dried fruit along several dimensions to provide such inattentive creatures additional priors to help inform their snack selection.
