\section{Introduction}

Since time immemorial humans have craved good things to eat.
Whether composing a sonnet, in the midst of an arduous task, or engaged in battle with a dragon, that truism throughout time remains: ``Red Warrior need food badly!''

Yet, who amongst us has the energy to choose the best snack for our mind and body when the crisis of low blood sugar afflicts us.
There is a clear need for advanced methodological research to answer these riddles for us such that we need only quickly consult the literature to solve this conundrum.

In this study, we compare and analyze two different snacks across several dimensions in order to provide an initial start to this necessary corpus.
We feel that this is a rich research realm ripe for further study.

Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample and compare certain snack items.
    \item Provide a recommendation between them.
    \item Motivate and promote further study.
\end{itemize}
